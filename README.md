![Application Icon](path/to/your/icon.png) <!-- Add your application icon here -->

The **Excel Compare Tool** is a WPF application designed to compare two Excel (`.xlsx`, `.xls`) or CSV (`.csv`) files and identify differences between them. It allows users to map sheets (for Excel files) and columns from both files and generate a detailed comparison report. The application is **self-contained**, meaning it does not require the .NET runtime to be installed separately.

## Features

- **Sheet Mapping (Excel Only)**: Map sheets and header rows from both Excel files.
- **Column Selection**: Select specific columns for comparison.
- **Comparison Report**: Generate a detailed report highlighting differences.
- **Export Results**: Export the comparison results to a new Excel or CSV file.
- **Self-Contained**: No need to install the .NET runtime separately.
